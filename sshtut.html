		<h1>Connecting to Wash with Gate One</h1>
		Wash is a computer sitting somewhere on campus. You'll need to access
		it to do your assignments. The following steps will guide you through connecting to it
		remotely from your computer, using a web browser.

		<h2>1. Be on Cornell campus, or use CU VPN.</h2>
		To connect, you'll either need to be on campus, or  you'll need to connect to Cornell's
		Virtual Private Network (VPN). To install and connect to CU VPN:
		<ol>
			<li>Navigate <a href="https://it.cornell.edu/cuvpn">here</a> and click the button
					that says ``Install CU VPN."
			<li>Select and follow the instructions corresponding to your OS.
			<li>Navigate back to <a href="https://it.cornell.edu/cuvpn">here</a> and click
					the button that says ``Connect to CU VPN".
			<li>Select and follow the instructions corresponding to your OS.
		</ol>

		<h2>2. Navigate to <a href="https://wash.cs.cornell.edu">wash.cs.cornell.edu</a>.</h2>
		Open up a web browser, and navigate to <a href="https://wash.cs.cornell.edu">wash.cs.cornell.edu</a>.
		You should see a dark web page with some header text that says ``Gate One - Applications".
		Click the button beneath it, which is labeled ``Terminal: SSH".

		<h2>3. Connect to the server.</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>You should first be prompted for something called <span id="tt">Host/IP or ssh:// URL</span>,
					which will identify where you want to connect. You can just press enter and the default value
					(<span id="tt">localhost</span>, indicated in the square brackets) will be selected, and
					will work.
			<li>The next prompt will say <span id="tt">Port</span>. Don't worry if you don't know what a
					port is yet. You can just use the default value.
			<li>Next it will ask for a <span id="tt">User</span>. Enter your assigned username. (You should receive
					this in an email before the first lecture.)
			<li>Finally, enter your assigned password.
		</ol>

		Now you should be connected! Please let a TA or the instructor know if you run into any issues.

		<h3>Public/Private Keys</h3>
		<p>You can always use your username and password to log into Wash. Another way people often log into
		computers remotely is with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public key</a>.
		An administrator would need to set this up for you; if your instructor never talks to you about this,
		you can ignore this section.</p>

		<p>If you do have a public key, you may find that the Gate One interface allows
		you to upload your private key. <b>Please do not upload your private key to Gate One!</b> It will be
		visible to everyone else using the service. Always keep your private key safe! If you ever run into
		a situation where you're worried about this, feel free to come talk to a member of the course staff.</p>
