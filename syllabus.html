            Hello, and welcome to CS2043 - Unix Tools and Systems! <br> <br>
            <h3> General Overview </h3>
            The primary learning objective of this class is comfort and familiarity. We want to empower you to feel as
            comfortable and confident in the bash shell as you would in a generic office program; maybe you don't know
            how to do everything at first, but you have the tools you need to figure the basics out, and the confidence
            that the more advanced features will be easy enough to discover in time. In service to this learning
            objective, the entire course will be conducted in a terminal-only Linux environment hosted in the
            department, on <a href="http://wash.cs.cornell.edu"> wash.cs.cornell.edu</a>. You'll get an account on this before the first lecture, and will use it
            to access, complete, and hand in all of your assignments. We will have a piazza for general questions, but
            otherwise everything's on wash. <br> <br>
            <h3> Structure of the Course </h3>
            The lectures in this course will be a mixture of traditional slide-based presentation and interactive
            hands-on labs. Students are encouraged to bring laptops or tablets with them to every class, but must
            restrict their use of these devices to only the interactive sessions. Students needing laptops outside of
            these interactive sessions may continue to use them, but must strive to avoid any activities --- like
            checking facebook or email --- that could prove distracting to the students around them. You have phones
            for that, if you truly feel you must :) <br> <br>
            <h3> Assignments and Grading </h3>
            Assignments will be completed and handed in on the course server, <a href="http://wash.cs.cornell.edu"> wash.cs.cornell.edu</a>. It is perfectly
            permissible to complete assignments on your own hardware and then transfer them to wash for handing in,
            though it may not always be possible or convenient to do so. Assignments will be due at the start of class
            unless otherwise noted. Assignments will strive to be small and easy to complete, again unless otherwise
            noted. Assignments will be due *frequently*; the first assignment, for example, will be due on Monday
            morning.<br> <br>
            This class will feature a small quiz component in the form of a "command of the day". Each class period
            will be associated with a command of the day; students are required to write out a short description (1-2
            sentences) of what this command does on an index card we provide, and turn it in at the front of the class.
            You can make up missed quizzes any time; just take extra index cards at the start of a later class period.
            <br> <br>
            Grading will be largely automated, and based around a check, check-plus, and check-minus system. It is
            possible to receive a grade of "autograder error"; we will investigate these grades at your request, and
            will automatically investigate all of these grades if it would effect your grade at the end of the
            semester. We will err on the generous side of grading; this is a mandatory pass-fail class, and students
            whose assignments average out to "check" will definitely pass it. <br> <br>
            <h3> Schedule of the Semester </h3>
            This is a tenuous plan for the semester, subject to change without notice. Please also refer to the
            schedule posted on the course website; the course schedule on the website is the authority. <br> <br>
