<p>Welcome to  the maze! Your task is to find a file named “victory” somewhere in a  subdirectory of maze. On the way, you’ll see a bunch of files called “README”  with hints as to where to look; you should print these out!</p>

<p>Start by  logging into wash. Next, we’ll need to make our way into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">maze</code> subdirectory. To do this, use the  command <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> to list the contents of  your current directory (your home or ~ directory). Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd course</code> to move to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">course</code> directory. Enter <code class="highlighter-rouge">cs2043</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">assignments</code>, and then <code class="highlighter-rouge">maze</code> similarly.</p>

<p>Once inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">maze</code>, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command. There is a README located here that contains a hint as to where to look for victory. You can print the README out using <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat README</code>. From here on, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> commands to find a file named “victory.”</p>

<p>Once you  find “victory,” hand this file in using <code class="highlighter-rouge">handin maze victory</code>.</p>

<p>As a  refresher, here are some helpful commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="command_index.html#Navigating_the_Unix_File_System_cmd_cd"><code class="highlighter-rouge">cd &lt; directory &gt;</code></a> changes your location to <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;  directory &gt;</code></li>
  <li><a href="command_index.html#Navigating_the_Unix_File_System_cmd_ls"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code></a> lists directory contents</li>
  <li><a href="command_index.html#Navigating_the_Unix_File_System_cmd_cat"><code class="highlighter-rouge">cat &lt; filename &gt;</code></a>  prints the contents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt; filename &gt;</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">..</code> is a special directory that means  “go up one level”</li>
</ul>

the assignment, please run the trolls_in_the_dungeon.sh command in

will this generate both a new dungeon/ and a new dungeon-key.sh. </span> 
<br /> <br /> 
 <span style="color:red"> Please note: Part 4 requires material we have 
not yet covered in class.  We will be covering the material required to 
complete this part of the assignment during the next lecture (Monday 
February 4). </span></p>
<h4 id="part-1-unlocking-the-chamber-of-d">Part 1: Unlocking the Chamber of d———!</h4>
<p>Welcome to the Chamber of d———!  You and Harry are about to enter 
the chamber but alas no Parseltounge password can open the chamber this 
time- only your amazing UNIX tools can help you unlock it!<br />
<br />
First let’s get to the entrance of the dungeon.  Start by logging into 
wash. Next, make your way into the <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon 
</span> subdirectory. To do this, use the command <span style="color:  #f50084"> ls </span> to list the contents of your current directory 
(your <span style="color: #f50084"> home </span> or <span style="color:  #f50084"> ~ </span> directory). Use <span style="color: #f50084"> cd 
course </span> to move to the course directory. Enter <span style="color: #f50084"> cs2043 </span> and then <span style="color:  #f50084"> assignments </span> and then <span style="color: #f50084"> 
project2 </span>.  Use <span style="color: #f50084"> ls </span> to list 
the contents of the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> 
directory.  See the <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon </span> 
directory?  Great!  Try entering that directory.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, you can’t seem to enter the dungeon.  Harry’s 
giving up already but you know exactly how you can get permission to 
access the <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon </span> directory.</p>
<h5 id="task-1-modify-permissions-of-the-dungeon-directory-so-you-can">Task 1: Modify permissions of the dungeon directory so you can</h5>
<p>enter.  Enter (using cd) into the dungeon directory.
Once you’re in, you want to check what’s inside the the dungeon.  So 
take the time to explore this directory using <span style="color:  #f50084"> ls </span> and <span style="color: #f50084"> cd </span>.  You 
list out the sub-directories but you can’t enter them or see what’s 
inside.  You don’t even know how many sub-directories and files there 
are within them.  Harry’s ready to give up (again) but you know you can 
solve this.  You remember outside the dungeon (in the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> directory) there was a <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon-key.sh </span> file.  You should <span style="color: #f50084"> cd </span> back to the <span style="color:  #f50084"> project2 </span> directory.
<br />
Try opening up <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon-key.sh </span> and 
read through the file.  Looks like you’ll have to write a few commands 
to unlock the dungeon fully:</p>
<h5 id="task-2-modify-dungeon-keysh-following-the-directions-on-the">Task 2: Modify dungeon-key.sh, following the directions on the</h5>
<p>script.  You will be writing commands that will allow you to complete 
the following 3 tasks:</p>
<ul> 
<li> modify the permissions of all directories within dungeon to have 
read-write-execute permissions for the user, read-execute permissions 
for group, and read-execute permissions for other. </li> 
<li> modify the permissions of all files within <span style="color: 
#f50084"> dungeon </span> to have read-write permissions for the user, 
read permission for the group, and no permissions for other. </li> 
<li> set the group owner of all files in dungeon (including those of its 
subdirectories) to 'cs2043student'
It's recommended that you finish these tasks in order. </li>
</ul>
<p>To run your dungeon-key.sh script, make sure you’re inside the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> directory and <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon-key.sh </span> is in this directory.<br />
Run the following command: <span style="color: #f50084"> 
./dungeon-key.sh </span>
<br />
To check if your script worked, try going back into dungeon and see if 
you can access its subdirectories and files.  Also make sure that you’ve 
checked that the group and permissions have been changed (Hint: maybe ls 
can help you with this).
<br />
When you’ve completed all the TODOs in dungeon-key.sh, make sure you are 
in the project2/ directory and hand in your script using <span style="color: #f50084"> handin enter-the-dungeon dungeon-key.sh </span></p>
<h4 id="part-2-making-your-own-secret-room">Part 2: Making Your Own Secret Room</h4>
<p>Now that you’re done with developing your own dungeon key, you’re ready 
to make your own secret room (directory).  Make sure you’re in the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> folder for this part.  Find a 
partner and create a new script file called <span style="color:  #f50084"> blueprint.sh </span> in the <span style="color: #f50084"> 
project2 </span> directory.  You will insert commands in this file that 
will create a directory in your <span style="color: #f50084"> ~ </span> 
directory that can’t be accessed by anyone unless they know the secret 
word (its name) (Hint: think about how you can set permissions so only 
those who know the name can access it).  Don’t tell your partner what 
the secret word is.  Once you’re done, ask your partner to find the 
secret directory you created through this script.  As long as they don’t 
know the name of the directory, they shouldn’t be able to find it within 
<span style="color: #f50084"> ~ </span>. 
<br />
Remember, this secret directory should be in <span style="color:  #f50084"> ~ </span>, but <span style="color: #f50084"> ~ </span> has 
permissions that are restricted right now.  Think about how you can 
allow for your partner to gain access into this directory but still not 
see the secret room you’ve created.
<br />
To run your <span style="color: #f50084"> blueprint.sh </span> script, 
make sure you’re inside the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 
</span> directory and blueprint.sh is in the project2/ directory.  Run 
the following command: <span style="color: #f50084"> ./blueprint.sh 
</span> 
<br />
When you’ve saved your work and are ready to submit, hand in your work 
using <span style="color: #f50084"> handin secret-room blueprint.sh 
</span> <br /> 
  <span style="color: red"> Please be aware that you should set the 
“other” and “group” permissions of your home directory (and secret 
directory) to be as restrictive as possible. Give only the permissions 
needed to access the room, and nothing more. Your partner should be able 
to do anything they want in the secret room. <br />
 In particular, think about which of the read/write/execute permissions 
you need on your home directory in order to get to the secret room. Make 
sure to try different things out! Change permissions and make 
observations about what your partner can and cannot do. </span></p>
<h4 id="part-3-exploring-the-dungeon">Part 3: Exploring the Dungeon</h4>
<p>Harry is impressed by your skills in unlocking the dungeon, but he 
thinks its time to actually explore the place.  Modify 
dungeon-counts.sh, following the directions on the script.  You will be 
writing commands that will allow you to complete the following 3 tasks:</p>
<li> Write a command that determines the total number of subdirectories 
within dungeon. </li>
<li> Write a command that determines the total number of files within 
dungeon. </li>
<li> Write a command that determines the total number of words within 
all the files of the dungeon directory. </li>
<p><br />
To run your dungeon-counts.sh script, make sure you’re inside the 
followup/ directory and dungeon-counts.sh is in the followup/ directory.<br />
Run the following command: ./dungeon-counts.sh
<br /> 
You will be submitting this script once you are done with the remaining 
part.</p>
<h4 id="part-4-piece-together-the-story">Part 4: Piece Together the Story</h4>
<h5 style="color:aqua;">Please note: Part 4 requires material we have 
not yet covered in class.  We will be covering the material required to 
complete this part of the assignment during the next lecture (Monday 
February 4). </h5>
<p>You’ll notice that many of the dungeon/ files contain snippets of text.<br />
We want to combine all the text snippets from all the dungeon/ files so 
we can form the original text.  Your script should properly combine all 
file contents properly and print this into standard output.  To execute 
the script, make sure you’re in followup/ and execute ./dungeon-story.sh
<br />
Hint: Take a look at the file names and see if you can identify a 
pattern to help you with  completing this task.
<br />
Testing Procedure: You may need to do some testing to ensure the final 
output is indeed the original text we are looking for.  In order to 
test, make sure you are in the followup/ directory.  Execute: 
./dungeon-story.sh &gt; test.txt
<br />
This will put the output of your script into a “test.txt” file in the 
followup/ directory.    Now execute:   md5sum test.txt
<br />
If you’ve written your script correctly, this should report 
‘1aa37d0a873f34121d9c7d3fe2ed5530’ as the sum.  If it is off by even one 
character, the script is incorrect.  Some types of errors an output can 
have include:</p>
<li> The ordering of the text snippets is incorrect </li>
<li> Not all text snippets are included in the output </li>
<li> The test.txt file does not end with a newline.  It must have a 
newline at the end in order to compute the right md5sum value.  To check 
if test.txt ends on a newline, execute cat test.txt.  If the terminal 
prompt $ shows up on the same line as the printed text, then test.txt is 
missing a newline at the end.  If it had a newline ending, then the $ 
prompt will start on a new line in the terminal. </li>
<p><br /> 
Make sure you’ve checked all your work for parts 3 and 4 before 
submitting.  When you’re ready to submit the two scripts, go back to the 
project2/ directory and hand in your work using handin 
explore-the-dungeon followup.  You’re finally done with Assignment 2!</p>

<p>In this assignment, we will be learning the fundamentals of Git through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a>-themed story.
If you would like a de-themed version of the assignment, please go <a href="/courses/cs2043/2019sp/dethemed_assignments.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Task</strong> sections complete parts of the assignment that must be completed for submission.
The <strong>Git Parable</strong> sections will help you gain <em>intuition</em> about how <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> works. No part of the <strong>Git Parable</strong> sections require submission.</p>

<p>Let’s git going!</p>

<p><span style="color: #FF0000">If you would like to reset (get a fresh copy) of any part of the assignment, please run <code class="highlighter-rouge">./reset.sh &lt;part_name&gt;</code>. For instance, if you would like to reset <code class="highlighter-rouge">part1</code>, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">./reset.sh part1</code>, and you’ll get a fresh copy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">part1</code> under <code class="highlighter-rouge">part1_fresh/</code>. You MUST delete your old copy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">partX/</code> and rename <code class="highlighter-rouge">partX_fresh</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">partX</code> for submission.</span></p>

<h4 id="part-1-its-tralfamadorian-time-">Part 1: It’s Tralfamadorian Time! ⏰</h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tralfamadore">Tralfamadorians</a> are back – your favorite green-eyed, time-bending, toilet plunger-like aliens! This time, they’ve chosen to abduct YOU for a lesson on time and the fourth dimension (<code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>).</p>

<p>Here: <span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span>, your Tralfamadorian abductress, will guide you through your enlightenment.</p>

<h5 id="time-is-just-snapshots-">Time is just Snapshots 📸</h5>

<p><span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span>: “All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. Us Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. We can see how permanent all the moments are, and we can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion that for Earthlings one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.”</p>

<p>Luckily, we are able to experience time just like the Tralfamadorians with our fourth-dimensional tool, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>!</p>

<h5 id="task-so-it-goes">Task: So it goes.</h5>

<p>Find <code class="highlighter-rouge">part1/</code> under <code class="highlighter-rouge">tralfamadorian-git-gud/</code>. 
(Don’t worry about <code class="highlighter-rouge">part1_dethemed/</code>. This is the dethemed version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">part1</code>, and you will get equal credit for submitting either version.)</p>

<p>You’ll find the following file structure:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.git/
billy.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you happen to open up <code class="highlighter-rouge">billy.txt</code>, you will see that Billy is dead. You wish Billy were still alive. <span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span> is back again to spread more Tralfamadorian wisdom…</p>

<p><span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span>: “That’s one thing Earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones.”</p>

<p>Here’s your task: <strong>REVIVE BILLY</strong> (Tralfamadorians may disagree whether this is actual revival or not) using your time-travelling <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> powers! Billy’s entire life has been kept track by <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>, and you can revive Billy through exploring snapshots of his life.</p>

<p>You can go back to <em>any</em> snapshot where Billy was alive.</p>

<p>Hint: a couple of useful <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> commands that may help you. Feel free to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">man</code> generously.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git log
git checkout
git reset
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span style="color: #FF0000"> WARNING: you will receive no credit for using three-dimensional (plain file editing) powers. You <em>must</em> use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> to “revive” Billy! </span></p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>For this part of the assignment, you <em>do not need to make any extra snapshots</em>.</p>

<p>If you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code> under part1/, you need to see this output on your terminal once you’ve completed this part.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you can see this and find that the most recent commit is where “Billy is alive”, you have successfully completed the assignment.</p>

<h5 id="-git-parable-snapshots-"><span style="color: #32CD32"> Git Parable: Snapshots </span></h5>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version control systems (VCS)</a> such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> take snapshots of your time. Think of them as save points in a video game. You can take snapshots of your codebase at anytime and resurrect that code on demand.</p>

<p>To make it easy to remember what changes you made in each snapshot (usually called a <code class="highlighter-rouge">commit</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> requires you to tag your snapshot with a <em>commit message</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Once you’re done with Part 1, hand it in by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">handin vonne-git-1 part1/</code>.</strong></p>

<h4 id="part-2-a-tralfamadorian-stage-">Part 2: A Tralfamadorian Stage 🎤</h4>

<p>This is (probably) Billy’s message of gratitude after his “revival”:</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000FF"> Billy </span>: “It is (has been) time for me to be dead for a little while - and then live again. (Thanks.)”</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000FF">Billy</span> is alive, but this doesn’t change the fact that you’re still abducted by our lovely <span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span>: “Well, here we are, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.”</p>

<h5 id="-git-parable-staging-"><span style="color: #32CD32"> Git Parable: Staging </span></h5>

<p>Snapshots can be represented as <code class="highlighter-rouge">commit</code>s. When you’re working on a project, you want to have explicit control over what is captured in each snapshot.</p>

<p>A <em>staging directory</em> is a set of changes (i.e. modified files) that you wish to capture in the next snapshot. In order to add files to your current staging directory, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code> (refer to its <code class="highlighter-rouge">man</code> page for more details).</p>

<h5 id="task-staging">Task: Staging</h5>

<p>This exercise will have you stage and commit in a particular order, so you can have a better sense of control over your <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> workflow.</p>

<p>Go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">part2/</code> to explore our upcoming Tralfamadorian Stage.</p>

<p>Surprise, <span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span> has planned a stage for you! However, you find that you need to relay pieces of information in a <em>certain order</em>.</p>

<p>In <code class="highlighter-rouge">part2/</code>, you should see the following files:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.git/
juggle.txt
jumprope.txt
jazz-hands.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As Tralfamadorians can only see time through snapshots (commits), you MUST provide your performance in snapshots. It is crucial that the snapshots are given in an order that will amuse them.</p>

<p>According to another Earthling waiting to perform, the trick is:</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000FF"> ?? </span>: “Jazz hands, Jumprope, THEN Juggle. Nothing else is acceptable around here.”</p>

<p>To survive this stage, <strong>provide snapshots that contain each of juggle, jumprope, and jazz hands in the order that is Tralfamadorian-approved.</strong> Do <em>not</em> provide a single snapshot with all three performances staged at once.</p>

<p>Hint: try running <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">git diff</code></p>

<p>Hint 2: you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "&lt;message&gt;"</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">commit</code> a snapshot with a message.</p>

<p><span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span>: “Each clump of symbols is a brief, urgent message– describing a situation, a scene. We Tralfamadorians read them all at once.”</p>

<p>When you’re done, you’ll have a <em>commit chain</em>, comprising of commit nodes that <em>point</em> to previous commits. Your commit chain should look “linear”, and each commit should be adding a single file to the snapshot:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   juggle

     |
     v

  jumprope

     |
     v

  jazz hands
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Time goes up; <code class="highlighter-rouge">juggle</code> is the latest.</p>

<p><span style="color: #FF0000"> Do <em>not</em> provide a single snapshot with all three performances staged at once. </span></p>

<p>(For instance, running</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
git commit -m "I've committed everything"
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>will be incorrect, as it provides exactly a single snapshot with all three performances staged at the same time.)</p>

<p><span style="color: #FF0000">For credit, each commit message must contain <em>information about what is being committed</em> (i.e. if you’re juggling, your commit message should contain the word “juggle”; jumproping - “jump”; jazz handing - “jazz”). </span></p>

<p><strong>Once you’re done with Part 2, hand it in by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">handin vonne-git-2 part2/</code>.</strong></p>

<h5 id="-git-parable-branching-"><span style="color: #32CD32"> Git Parable: Branching </span></h5>

<p>Recall our “linear” commit chain.Time goes up; <code class="highlighter-rouge">juggle</code> is the latest.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   juggle

     |
     v

  jumprope

     |
     v

 jazz hands
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Imagine this is going to be your stable release for a Tralfamadorian software (that jazz hands, jumpropes, then juggles.). You release the software at the point of <code class="highlighter-rouge">juggle</code>.</p>

<p>A month passes by and you decide to add more snapshots.
Time goes up; <code class="highlighter-rouge">unicycling</code> is the latest.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   unicycling

     |
     V

   juggle (release)

     |
     V

  jumprope

     |
     V
  jazz hands

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, bug reports start filing in and people start having problems with your juggling. You decide to fix the bug in a snapshot called <code class="highlighter-rouge">fixed-juggle</code> and re-release your code. However, you don’t want to release your <code class="highlighter-rouge">unicycling</code> snapshot.</p>

<p>Here, we find a couple problems that cannot be solved by our linear workflow. First, we don’t know where our <code class="highlighter-rouge">fixed-juggle</code> snapshot will go. Second, we need a way for both <code class="highlighter-rouge">unicycling</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">fixed-juggle</code> have a reference to the original <code class="highlighter-rouge">juggle</code> snapshot, so that the snapshot history is not lost.</p>

<p>As a solution, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> introduces a <em>tree structure</em> to its workflow, where we can have <em>branches</em> to keep track of any non-linear workflow. Time goes up; both <code class="highlighter-rouge">unicycling</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">fixed-juggle</code> are the latest.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  unicycling    fixed-juggle (release)
     |           /
     V        /
   juggle

     |
     V

  jumprope

     |
     V

 jazz hands

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="part-3-tralfamadorian-trivia-night-">Part 3: Tralfamadorian Trivia Night 🌙</h4>

<p>As our final part of this Tralfamadorian Odyssey, <span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span> has invited you to the sesquicentennial Tralfamadorian Trivia Night.</p>

<p><span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span> seems a little animated, although it is hard to tell. She tells you it’s the favorite event of her lifetime.</p>

<p><span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span>: “Absolutely everybody gets a little something.”</p>

<p>She promises you that the abduction will come to an end once you complete the Trivia.</p>

<p><em>Feel free to utilize Office Hours for any questions about this section. Although help will be provided through Piazza, it will help your intuition in understanding <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> if explained in person!</em></p>

<h5 id="-git-parable-collaboration-"><span style="color: #32CD32"> Git Parable: Collaboration </span></h5>

<p>One of the benefits of using <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> is the ability to collaborate. So far, we’ve been using your local <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> repository to keep track of your workflow.</p>

<p>By having a remote shared repository, you can share your snapshots with others.</p>

<p>In this next exercise, you will have a chance to create a GitHub repository and solve some Trivia with a partner.</p>

<h5 id="task-1-another-earthling">Task 1: Another Earthling</h5>

<p>You must find an Earthling partner (enrolled in CS 2043) for the Trivia. You may use Piazza’s partner finding functionality.</p>

<p>Tralfamadorian partners also accepted, if found.</p>

<h5 id="task-2-solve-your-trivia">Task 2: Solve Your Trivia</h5>

<p>Solve the questions under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">part3</code> directory <em>on your own</em>. Correctness of your solutions does not matter for the Trivia (but is good for your soul).</p>

<h5 id="task-3-merge-time">Task 3: Merge time!</h5>

<p>Create a new GitHub repository through the <a href="https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/">CornellCIS GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Place the created <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> repository under your <code class="highlighter-rouge">part3</code> directory (<code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone &lt;git-repository-url&gt;</code> may help).</p>

<p>In order to complete the Trivia, you must succeed in the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>add your Earthling partner as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">collaborator</code> to the repository</li>
  <li>both Earthlings must <code class="highlighter-rouge">commit</code> their questions and solutions to the repository. Earthlings may have different questions.</li>
  <li>any <code class="highlighter-rouge">merge</code> conflicts must be resolved.</li>
  <li>the resulting solutions to the Trivia must be pushed onto the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch of your repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: In order to successfully follow these steps, <em>exactly one</em> person should initialize the GitHub repository and push a commit to it, <em>then</em> the next person should clone the repository and push a commit.</p>

<p><span style="color: #FF0000"> WARNING: do <strong>not</strong> use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git rebase</code> for the purposes of this assignment. <span></span></span></p>

<h5 id="-git-parable-collaboration-and-merging-"><span style="color: #32CD32"> Git Parable: Collaboration and Merging </span></h5>

<p>At the end of this assignment, you should have a complete snapshot (your partner and yours) of your Trivia (check <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log</code>).</p>

<p>Through <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>, you can merge two separate branches of development into a single snapshot. Once you complete a merge, and all partners fetch all the snapshots from the master branch (<code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull</code>), both of your histories (<code class="highlighter-rouge">git log</code>) should match exactly.</p>

<p>As you’re preparing to leave, <span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span> has something to say.</p>

<p><span style="color: #00FF00"> qkfzca </span>: “Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.”</p>

<p><strong>Once you’re done with Part 3, follow these instructions for submission</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> your repo onto <code class="highlighter-rouge">wash</code>, onto your <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/Desktop</code>. This must be a fresh clone.</li>
  <li>run <code class="highlighter-rouge">handin vonne-git-3 &lt;git-repo-directory&gt;</code>. For instance, if your <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone</code>-ing your GitHub repository created a directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trivia/</code>, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">handin vonne-git-3 Trivia/</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="poo-tee-weet">Poo-tee-weet?</h5>

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully escaped Tralfamadore.</p>

<p>Now that you’re back on Earth, you realize it’s springtime. Birds are talking.</p>

<p>One bird says to you, ‘Poo-tee-weet?’</p>
