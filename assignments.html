<p><span style="color: red"> NOTE: If you need to generate a new copy of the assignment, please run the trolls_in_the_dungeon.sh command in project2/ .  This will refresh the dungeon directory but not overwrite dungeon-key.sh or blueprint.sh.  If you need a new copy of dungeon-key.sh, please move your current dungeon-key.sh out of project2/ and run the trolls_in_the_dungeon.sh command in project2/.  Only then will this generate both a new dungeon/ and a new dungeon-key.sh. </span> <br /> <br /> 
 <span style="color:red"> Please note: Part 4 requires material we have not yet covered in class.  We will be covering the material required to complete this part of the assignment during the next lecture (Monday February 4). </span></p>
<h4 id="part-1-unlocking-the-chamber-of-d">Part 1: Unlocking the Chamber of d———!</h4>
<p>Welcome to the Chamber of d———!  You and Harry are about to enter the chamber but alas no Parseltounge password can open the chamber this time- only your amazing UNIX tools can help you unlock it!<br />
<br />
First let’s get to the entrance of the dungeon.  Start by logging into wash. Next, make your way into the <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon </span> subdirectory. To do this, use the command <span style="color: #f50084"> ls </span> to list the contents of your current directory (your <span style="color: #f50084"> home </span> or <span style="color: #f50084"> ~ </span> directory). Use <span style="color: #f50084"> cd course </span> to move to the course directory. Enter <span style="color: #f50084"> cs2043 </span> and then <span style="color: #f50084"> assignments </span> and then <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span>.  Use <span style="color: #f50084"> ls </span> to list the contents of the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> directory.  See the <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon </span> directory?  Great!  Try entering that directory.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, you can’t seem to enter the dungeon.  Harry’s giving up already but you know exactly how you can get permission to access the <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon </span> directory.</p>
<h5 id="task-1-modify-permissions-of-the-dungeon-directory-so-you-can-enter--enter-using-cd-into-the-dungeon-directory">Task 1: Modify permissions of the dungeon directory so you can enter.  Enter (using cd) into the dungeon directory.</h5>
<p>Once you’re in, you want to check what’s inside the the dungeon.  So take the time to explore this directory using <span style="color: #f50084"> ls </span> and <span style="color: #f50084"> cd </span>.  You list out the sub-directories but you can’t enter them or see what’s inside.  You don’t even know how many sub-directories and files there are within them.  Harry’s ready to give up (again) but you know you can solve this.  You remember outside the dungeon (in the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> directory) there was a <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon-key.sh </span> file.  You should <span style="color: #f50084"> cd </span> back to the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> directory.
<br />
Try opening up <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon-key.sh </span> and read through the file.  Looks like you’ll have to write a few commands to unlock the dungeon fully:</p>
<h5 id="task-2-modify-dungeon-keysh-following-the-directions-on-the-script--you-will-be-writing-commands-that-will-allow-you-to-complete-the-following-3-tasks">Task 2: Modify dungeon-key.sh, following the directions on the script.  You will be writing commands that will allow you to complete the following 3 tasks:</h5>
<ul> 
<li> modify the permissions of all directories within dungeon to have read-write-execute permissions for the user, read-execute permissions for group, and read-execute permissions for other. </li> 
<li> modify the permissions of all files within <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon </span> to have read-write permissions for the user, read permission for the group, and no permissions for other. </li> 
<li> set the group owner of all files in dungeon (including those of its subdirectories) to 'cs2043student'
It's recommended that you finish these tasks in order. </li>
</ul>
<p>To run your dungeon-key.sh script, make sure you’re inside the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> directory and <span style="color: #f50084"> dungeon-key.sh </span> is in this directory.  Run the following command: <span style="color: #f50084"> ./dungeon-key.sh </span>
<br />
To check if your script worked, try going back into dungeon and see if you can access its subdirectories and files.  Also make sure that you’ve checked that the group and permissions have been changed (Hint: maybe ls can help you with this).
<br />
When you’ve completed all the TODOs in dungeon-key.sh, make sure you are in the project2/ directory and hand in your script using <span style="color: #f50084"> handin enter-the-dungeon dungeon-key.sh </span></p>
<h4 id="part-2-making-your-own-secret-room">Part 2: Making Your Own Secret Room</h4>
<p>Now that you’re done with developing your own dungeon key, you’re ready to make your own secret room (directory).  Make sure you’re in the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> folder for this part.  Find a partner and create a new script file called <span style="color: #f50084"> blueprint.sh </span> in the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> directory.  You will insert commands in this file that will create a directory in your <span style="color: #f50084"> ~ </span> directory that can’t be accessed by anyone unless they know the secret word (its name) (Hint: think about how you can set permissions so only those who know the name can access it).  Don’t tell your partner what the secret word is.  Once you’re done, ask your partner to find the secret directory you created through this script.  As long as they don’t know the name of the directory, they shouldn’t be able to find it within <span style="color: #f50084"> ~ </span>. 
<br />
Remember, this secret directory should be in <span style="color: #f50084"> ~ </span>, but <span style="color: #f50084"> ~ </span> has permissions that are restricted right now.  Think about how you can allow for your partner to gain access into this directory but still not see the secret room you’ve created.
<br />
To run your <span style="color: #f50084"> blueprint.sh </span> script, make sure you’re inside the <span style="color: #f50084"> project2 </span> directory and blueprint.sh is in the project2/ directory.  Run the following command: <span style="color: #f50084"> ./blueprint.sh </span> 
<br />
When you’ve saved your work and are ready to submit, hand in your work using <span style="color: #f50084"> handin secret-room blueprint.sh </span> <br /></p>

<p><span style="color: red"> Please be aware that you should set the “other” and “group” permissions of your home directory (and secret directory) to be as restrictive as possible. Give only the permissions needed to access the room, and nothing more. Your partner should be able to do anything they want in the secret room. <br />
 In particular, think about which of the read/write/execute permissions you need on your home directory in order to get to the secret room. Make sure to try different things out! Change permissions and make observations about what your partner can and cannot do. </span></p>

<h4 id="part-3-exploring-the-dungeon">Part 3: Exploring the Dungeon</h4>
<p>Harry is impressed by your skills in unlocking the dungeon, but he thinks its time to actually explore the place.  Modify dungeon-counts.sh, following the directions on the script.  You will be writing commands that will allow you to complete the following 3 tasks:</p>
<li> Write a command that determines the total number of subdirectories within dungeon. </li>
<li> Write a command that determines the total number of files within dungeon. </li>
<li> Write a command that determines the total number of words within all the files of the dungeon directory. </li>
<p><br />
To run your dungeon-counts.sh script, make sure you’re inside the followup/ directory and dungeon-counts.sh is in the followup/ directory.  Run the following command: ./dungeon-counts.sh
<br /> 
You will be submitting this script once you are done with the remaining part.</p>

<h4 id="part-4-piece-together-the-story">Part 4: Piece Together the Story</h4>
<h5 style="color:aqua;">Please note: Part 4 requires material we have not yet covered in class.  We will be covering the material required to complete this part of the assignment during the next lecture (Monday February 4). </h5>
<p>You’ll notice that many of the dungeon/ files contain snippets of text.  We want to combine all the text snippets from all the dungeon/ files so we can form the original text.  Your script should properly combine all file contents properly and print this into standard output.  To execute the script, make sure you’re in followup/ and execute ./dungeon-story.sh
<br />
Hint: Take a look at the file names and see if you can identify a pattern to help you with  completing this task.
<br />
Testing Procedure: You may need to do some testing to ensure the final output is indeed the original text we are looking for.  In order to test, make sure you are in the followup/ directory.  Execute: ./dungeon-story.sh &gt; test.txt
<br />
This will put the output of your script into a “test.txt” file in the followup/ directory.    Now execute:   md5sum test.txt
<br />
If you’ve written your script correctly, this should report ‘1aa37d0a873f34121d9c7d3fe2ed5530’ as the sum.  If it is off by even one character, the script is incorrect.  Some types of errors an output can have include:</p>
<li> The ordering of the text snippets is incorrect </li>
<li> Not all text snippets are included in the output </li>
<li> The test.txt file does not end with a newline.  It must have a newline at the end in order to compute the right md5sum value.  To check if test.txt ends on a newline, execute cat test.txt.  If the terminal prompt $ shows up on the same line as the printed text, then test.txt is missing a newline at the end.  If it had a newline ending, then the $ prompt will start on a new line in the terminal. </li>
<p><br /> 
Make sure you’ve checked all your work for parts 3 and 4 before submitting.  When you’re ready to submit the two scripts, go back to the project2/ directory and hand in your work using handin explore-the-dungeon followup.  You’re finally done with Assignment 2!</p>
