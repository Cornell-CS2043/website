<p>In this assignment, we will be writing more advanced scripts through a Lord of the Rings themed story. 
If you would like a de-themed version of the assignment, please go <a href="/courses/cs2043/2019sp/dethemed_assignments.html">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frodo sits quietly reading a book in the forest, dreaming of the day when Gandalf will
return with some more fireworks.  More importantly, though, he grows weary of looking
after the increasingly frustrating senility of Bilbo.  Unbeknownst to Bilbo, Frodo,
and even Gandalf, though, treachery is afoot.  As it turns out, the great Base Master
of Treachery (Sauron) really engineered the rings of power to siphon intellect from
the wearer of the ring.  He wanted to live forever, but was well versed in the
unfortunate truth of how the brain ages and realized he could steal the ring-bearer’s
marbles for himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="task-1">Task 1</h4>

<p>Note: You will be appending to two files, <code class="highlighter-rouge">MARBLES.txt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FAILED.log</code>, in this task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frodo’s least favorite task of the day is helping Bilbo find his marbles.  All the old
fool does day in and day out is shut himself in his study and re-read is various maps
and journals, muttering on about how if he could only find his marbles then he could
return to live with the Elves.  The only thing that Frodo hates more than “helping”
Bilbo find his marbles is playing the “What’s in my Pocket game”, because the answer
is always the same.</p>

  <p>Each day between Elevenses and Lunch Bilbo demands that Frodo assist in the age-old
task of the marble search.  Having been traumatized by this search everyday since the
time he could walk, Frodo has finally decided that he should automate the process.
According to Bilbo, he has encoded the secret location of the marbles in different
maps and journals throughout his study.  However, these maps and journals were
actually given to him by the Elves (who stole them from Dwarves), and it is futile to
search for marbles on the wrong day of the year.</p>

  <p>Each day Bilbo recites a list of maps and journals that are valid to search on that
day from memory, and Frodo must collect them all and search for the marbles.  Bilbo
also informs Frodo that there is a minimum and maximum line-length (specific to that
day) that would potentially contain the location of a given marble.  That is, as Frodo
reads through every line of the journals and maps, if a given line of prose contains
fewer words than the dictated minimum, or more words than the dictated maximum, then
no marbles have been described by that line and Frodo should move on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Create a script named <code class="highlighter-rouge">collect_marbles.sh</code> in the <strong>TASK_1</strong> directory that performs the
following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The script will be called with arguments as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>The “length” of a line is defined as <strong>the number of words on the line</strong>.</li>
      <li>The first argument is the <em>minimum</em> length of a line.</li>
      <li>The second argument is the <em>maximum</em> length of a line.</li>
      <li>All remaining arguments are the names of the journals and maps that are to be
searched (filenames).  There is no limit to the number of additional arguments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your script receives <strong>fewer than 3</strong> arguments, it should print the exact message to STDERR:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> Ye shall not search for marbles if ye cannot find the key.
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>and produce an <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> code of <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">64</code></strong>, without doing any further processing. AKA
 check for this at the beginning before doing anything else…
 In order to redirect to STDERR, you can type <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;&amp;2 echo "error"</code>. This means you are redirecting the output of echo (in this case, “error”) to file descriptor 2. In the world of UNIX, file descriptor 2 represents STDERR, whereas file descriptor 1 represents STDOUT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You may assume that arguments one and two, <em>if supplied</em>, are positive integers where:
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>minimum</strong> length is greater than or equal to 1.</li>
      <li>The <strong>maximum</strong> length is greater than or equal to the <strong>minimum</strong> length (never
less than).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You may <strong>not</strong> assume that the third and higher arguments are <strong>valid</strong>.  That is,
you must verify that the argument given <em>is a file you can <strong>r</strong>ead</em> first before
trying to process it.
    <ul>
      <li>If an argument given is not a real file, <strong>append</strong> the name that was given to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">FAILED.log</code> in the current directory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For every valid file path specified, loop over every line in the file:
    <ul>
      <li>Count the number of words on that line. A word is defined as anything separated by a space.</li>
      <li>If the number of words is between the <strong>minimum</strong> and <strong>maximum</strong> that Bilbo
specified, <strong>append</strong> it to the end of <code class="highlighter-rouge">MARBLES.txt</code> in the current directory.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, just move on to the next line.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: for full credit, <code class="highlighter-rouge">TASK_1/collect_marbles.sh</code> must be executable.</p>

<p>Once you are done, hand in the assignment using <code class="highlighter-rouge">handin fellowship-1 collect_marbles.sh</code></p>

<h4 id="sample-inputs-and-output">Sample Inputs and Output</h4>

<p>Refer to TASK_1/TASK_1_EXAMPLE.md.</p>

<h4 id="task-2">Task 2</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frodo can at long last enjoy a little bit of “me-time”, as Bilbo refuses to allow
Frodo to be involved in the decryption phase.  Somewhat agitated by the fact that
Bilbo will not allow him to partake in this task after all these years, Frodo decides
to return to the forest to catch up on some reading.  After all, he doesn’t really
even want to be involved in that part…Bilbo claims that marble decryption must be
done whilst wearing a tea cosy on your head and nothing else.</p>

  <p>As Frodo tries to forget that mental image, he is knocked over by Pippin and Merry who
seem to have come out of nowhere.  It becomes quite apparent that not only have they
been stealing crops from Farmer Maggot, but they have been stealing his marbles too!
They realized that the more marbles they steal from Farmer Maggot, the easier it is to
steal crops (since they are effectively degrading his consciousness).</p>

  <p>Intrigued by the idea, and appalled by the act, Frodo is now entrenched in an awkward
situation.  Pippin and Merry somehow already found out that Frodo is a total Unix
scripting pro, and have asked him to help them create a tool that would enable them to
analyze their potential profits from both the crops and the marbles.</p>

  <p>Frodo realizes that they are too foolish to connect the dots that if they would only
eat the marbles they could write their own, and strikes a deal: he will create this
tool for them if they pay him with the marbles they have stolen.  He convinces them
that once removed they are useless, and that they can only make a profit from the
crops anyway.</p>

  <p>They are suspicious, but Frodo explains that he is going to try and use them to
satiate Bilbo’s ludicrous marble search.  Having grown up with Frodo, they accept this
as a plausible application.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>You are to create a script <code class="highlighter-rouge">merry_math.sh</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TASK_2</code> directory that can analyze
specific columns of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> file.  A <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> file is a “Comma Separated Value” sheet often
used for storing data such as the number of carrots or potatoes stolen on a given day.
Ordinarily <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> files are supposed to have the first row be the “Header”, that
describes what each column is.  For this task, there will be no header to simplify your
work. There will also be no quotes or other strange characters you need to worry about. Just assume it will be plain text separated by commas.</p>

<hr />

<p>Your script must support the following <strong>integer arithmetic</strong> operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code>: add the specified columns together.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">sub</code>: subtract the specified columns.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mul</code>: multiply the specified columns.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code>: divide the specified columns.
    <ul>
      <li>Do not be concerned about division by 0, you can assume it will not happen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You do not need to be concerned with {over,under}flow.  For the interested,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code> 3.0+ uses signed 64 bit integers (regardless of the architecture).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Your script will receive input arguments in the following form:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">"$1"</code>: the name of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> file.  This file is not guaranteed to exist.
    <ul>
      <li>If the file does <strong>not</strong> exist, simply <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> with code <code class="highlighter-rouge">66</code>.</li>
      <li>This error code takes precedence over an invalid operation code (next bullet.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">"$2"</code>: the operation you are to perform, one of <code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sub</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">mul</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>If the operation is not one of these four strings, you should <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> with code <code class="highlighter-rouge">69</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">"$3"</code>..<code class="highlighter-rouge">"$n"</code>: an integer specifying the columns to perform the operation on.
    <ul>
      <li>These are not guaranteed to exist.</li>
      <li>This has no effect on the code you write, but these do not have to be specified in
order of the actual <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> file.  For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$3"</code> could be column <code class="highlighter-rouge">12</code>, and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">"$4"</code> could be column <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>.</li>
      <li>You may assume that <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$3"</code>..<code class="highlighter-rouge">"$n"</code> contain valid column numbers: they are positive
integers, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> specified by <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$1"</code> has at least as many columns as these
arguments (aka don’t worry about validating if there are that many columns).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If fewer than four arguments <strong>total</strong> are given, <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> with code <code class="highlighter-rouge">64</code>.  This error
should take precedence over the error codes for <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$1"</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$2"</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>This is easier for you!  Just check <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$#"</code> first and make sure it is &gt;= 4…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To be extra clear, you should check errors in the following order to provide the correct
error code priorities:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if too few arguments, then
    exit with an error code of 64
else if the provided filename is not a file, then
    exit with an error code of 66
else if the operation code provided is not supported, then
    exit with an error code of 69
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So if four arguments were provided, but both the filename and operation code were
invalid, then the <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> code should be <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">66</code></strong>, not <code class="highlighter-rouge">69</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Your script is to strip the columns requested and perform the mathematical operation
requested.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The computation is to be written to the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESULTS.txt</code>.</li>
  <li>If the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESULTS.txt</code> already exists, overwrite it (in order to do this, write <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt; RESULTS.txt</code> before doing any other parsing).</li>
  <li>
    <p>The computation you should perform is the <em>operation</em> on the columns, in order.
For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>With operation <code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code> and arguments <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$3"</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$4"</code> supplied, compute:</p>

        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">(</span> <span class="nv">$3</span> + <span class="nv">$4</span> <span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>With operation <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> and arguments <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$3"</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$4"</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$5"</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$6"</code> supplied,
compute:</p>

        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">(((</span> <span class="nv">$3</span> / <span class="nv">$4</span> <span class="o">)</span> / <span class="nv">$5</span> <span class="o">)</span> / <span class="nv">$6</span> <span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Parentheses were added for clarity, but you will need to execute this task in a
loop and will not really need to worry about grouping expressions like this.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: for full credit, <code class="highlighter-rouge">TASK_2/merry_math.sh</code> must be executable.</p>

<p>Once you are done, hand in the assignment using <code class="highlighter-rouge">handin fellowship-2 merry_math.sh</code></p>

<h4 id="sample-inputs-and-output-1">Sample Inputs and Output</h4>

<p>Refer to TASK_2/TASK_2_EXAMPLE.md.</p>

<h4 id="task-3">Task 3</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enthralled by the superb automation he is now able to perform, Frodo ponders what
could possibly be next.  As Pippin and Merry go skipping away contented with their new
calculator, Frodo hears a faint but familiar song being hummed off in the distance.
Taken aback by the comforting melody, he decides to go track down who could possibly
be such a talented songster.  For not only is there humming, but a unique form of
whistling that he suspects would summon even the most regal and renowned of horses.</p>

  <p>Frolicking through the forest, he comes to a road just as Gandalf the Omnipotently
Nonchalant rides his carriage toward the Shire.  Unable to contain his joy (because
this almost certainly means there will be fireworks), he leaps from the side of the
road onto Gandalf’s cart.  Gandalf laughs in a manner that makes Frodo think there may
be some marbles missing from Gandalf as well, but dares not to ask.</p>

  <p>As they ride in to town, Gandalf turns to Frodo and inquires whether he might be
interested in helping him con Sauron.  For too many years Gandalf has been
overshadowed by him, and seeks the title of Great Deceiver, but he is far too old to
learn how to use computers and needs help designing a website.  Gandalf was able to
convince Sam to create a Markdown document for the website in exchange for some
potatoes, but despite great efforts Sam was simply just too simple to be able to
create anything more interesting.</p>

  <p>Gandalf is confident that he will need a colorful website in order to pull off this
scandal, and turns to Frodo.  Having learned of his recent super-pro-allstar status as
a Unix guru, Gandalf is confident that Frodo will be able to provide a tool that can
take any one of the the Markdown documents Sam completes and generate a colorful HTML
page.</p>

  <p>Gandalf scurries away claiming that there are questions, questions that need answering,
and Frodo is left to himself to complete the task alone (once again).  Intimidated by
<code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code>, Frodo gobbles down his newly acquired Maggot-Marbles and instantly feels ready
to complete his next task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are to <em>modify</em> the script <code class="highlighter-rouge">gandalfify.sh</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TASK_3</code> directory to be a
relatively basic Markdown to HTML parser.  You will need to utilize <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code> to complete
this task.  You do not need to understand the syntax of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Markdown</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTML</code> in order to
complete this task – just follow the directions and it will work.  I have chosen to
give you this assignment because it gives you visual confirmation that you have been
successful.</p>

<p>Before enumerating the tasks explicitly, I must describe some <code class="highlighter-rouge">BSD</code> vs <code class="highlighter-rouge">GNU</code>
compatibility issues.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="forbidden-behavior">Forbidden Behavior:</h4>

<p>Under no circumstances are you allowed to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-i</code> flag for <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code>.  If you use it,
you will receive 0 points.  It is not portable, and you should have no reason to use it.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="required-behavior">Required Behavior:</h4>

<p>You will likely want to to use <em>extended</em> regular expressions for this task.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code>
operator (which means find one or more of the expression it modifies), for example, is
part of the <em>extended</em> regular expressions.  For example, the regex <code class="highlighter-rouge">[a-z]+</code> simply
denotes “one or more lowercase letter”.  Strings that are in this set would be things
like <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">asdf</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">fdsa</code>, etc.</p>

<p>GNU <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code> uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-r</code> flag to indicate that <em>extended</em> regular expressions are
permitted, whereas the BSD (and therefore OSX) <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code> uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-E</code> (capital, not lower
case!) flag to enable these.  However, as it turns out, even though the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-E</code> flag is not
present in the GNU <code class="highlighter-rouge">man sed</code> page, it is supported and is exactly the same as <code class="highlighter-rouge">-r</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="task-31-generate-the-paragraphs-p-tags-for-html">Task 3.1: Generate the Paragraphs (<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code> tags) for HTML</h4>

<p>You should assume that <strong>any</strong> line that has text, but does <strong>not</strong> start with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>
sign will turn into a paragraph.  In Markdown, you can create headers (title sections)
by starting the line with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> and writing the title afterward.  For example, these are
all valid Markdown headers:</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh"># This is an H1 header</span>

This is a regular paragraph.

<span class="gu">##          This is an H2 header</span>

This is another regular paragraph.

<span class="gu">###    This is an H3 header.</span>

This is yet another regular paragraph.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that there is an arbitrary amount of whitespace (that is <em>not</em> a newline) before
the headers.  We will account for this in task 3.2. A friendly reminder of some things that
might be useful:</p>

<p>As in class, we discussed how to only do replacements with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code> if the line starts with
a certain regex. This command only checks lines <em>beginning</em> with “The”:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sed '/^The/s/john/John/g' file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What we haven’t discussed is how to check lines that <em>don’t begin</em> with “The”, which is done
as follows:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sed '/^The/!s/john/John/g' file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For this task, you need to surround the regular paragraphs with the HTML paragraph tag. 
In HTML, you start a tag with <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;tag&gt;</code>, and end it with <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;/tag&gt;</code> (where the ending has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>).  The
paragraph tag is <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code>.  So for example, you would take the line</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   This is a regular paragraph.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and turn it into</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is a regular paragraph.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For simplicity, you can assume that there will not be any preceding whitespace before
the text you are to turn into a paragraph.  So you will not have to account for
something like</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>       This is a weird paragraph with preceding whitespace.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Go ahead and get started!  You should write your solutions <code class="highlighter-rouge">TASK_3/gandalfify.sh</code> in the appropriate
section.  Read the comments, you will see it.</p>

<h4 id="task-32-generate-the-headers-for-html">Task 3.2: Generate the Headers for HTML</h4>

<p>At this point we now have all of our paragraphs accounted for, and can start turning the
various levels of <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> into the appropriate header.  You will need to account for only the 
cases in which you have 1, 2, or 3 #s, corresponding to <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;h3&gt;</code> respectively.</p>

<p>Working with the example we started above, our text now looks something like this:</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh"># This is an H1 header</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is a regular paragraph.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="gu">##          This is an H2 header</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is another regular paragraph.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="gu">###    This is an H3 header.</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is yet another regular paragraph.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You need to produce</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;h1&gt;This is an H1 header&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a regular paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is an H2 header&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another regular paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This is an H3 header.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is yet another regular paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Note that I have removed the whitespace between the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> and the text.  You must do
the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The whitespace in <code class="highlighter-rouge">MARBLE_SHOPPE.md</code> has a mixture of spaces and tabs in some cases.
You must catch these.
    <ul>
      <li>Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">POSIX</code> sets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Note: Lines with no whitespace between the “#” and text should still be converted to headers.</p>

    <div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gu">##Header 2 with no whitespace must be parsed correctly</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>should be</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   &lt;h2&gt;Header 2 with no whitespace must be parsed correctly&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="using-the-script">Using the Script</h4>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">gandalfify.sh</code> script expects exactly one argument: the name of the Markdown
document file to be parsed / turned into an HTML document.  Simply specify the name of
the file you want to parse.  For example, assuming you were in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">a4/TASK_3</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span> ./gandalfify.sh MARBLE_SHOPPE.md
<span class="go">Converted MARBLE_SHOPPE.md into index.html!
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>From there, you can “visually debug” by simply opening <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> in your browser.
The cool thing is you can keep it open in the browser, and re-run the script and then
just refresh your browser to see the updated version :)</p>

<p>From there, if you would like to “visually debug”, you may use SCP to transfer the HTML file to 
your local computer and open <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> in your browser.</p>

<p>Once you are done, hand in the assignment using <code class="highlighter-rouge">handin fellowship-3 gandalfify.sh</code></p>

<h4 id="sample-input-and-output">Sample Input and Output</h4>

<p>Refer to TASK_3/TASK_3_EXAMPLE.md.</p>

<h4 id="challenge-questions-optional---we-will-not-grade-this-but-you-might-find-it-fun">Challenge Questions (optional - we will not grade this, but you might find it fun!)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Produce proper indentation automatically using <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code>.  I have left the indentation
variables defined at the top of <code class="highlighter-rouge">gandalfify.sh</code> for you.  This should actually be
rather simple once you have finished the rest of the task.  Just a proof of concept.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an un-ordered list in <code class="highlighter-rouge">MARBLE_SHOPPE.md</code>, but each element will get parsed
into a separate paragraph.  Turn them into HTML unordered lists.</p>

    <p>Unordered lists in Markdown come in a variety of forms:</p>

    <div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">+</span> one format uses plus signs
<span class="p">+</span> to indicate new bullets
<span class="p">+</span> in the list
<span class="p">
-</span> one format uses hyphens
<span class="p">-</span> to indicate new bullets
<span class="p">-</span> in the list
<span class="p">
*</span> one format uses plus asterisks
<span class="p">*</span> to indicate new bullets
<span class="p">*</span> in the list
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>They are all equivalent, and you can assume that I will not mix them (<code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code> for
example, will not be used in the same list).</p>

    <p>The HTML unordered list is as follows:</p>

    <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>This is an item.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>This is another item.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>This is the last item.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>So you will not only need to surround each bullet from Markdown in an <code class="highlighter-rouge">li</code> tag, but
you will have to be able to find the beginning and end of the list and put the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code>
tag.  You should assume that there will not be any newlines between bullet points.
For example:</p>

    <div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> This list is acceptable
<span class="p">-</span> Because it is
<span class="p">-</span> Formatted correctly
<span class="p">-</span> Yay!
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>whereas</p>

    <div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> This list will end up as two separate lists
<span class="p">-</span> Because there is an empty line between them
<span class="p">
-</span> And your regex will see this as the end of the list
<span class="p">-</span> ...most likely.
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>
